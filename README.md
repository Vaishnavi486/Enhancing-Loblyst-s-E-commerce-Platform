**Task:**
Enhancing Loblyst’s E-commerce Platform – Prototype Development and Optimization

**Overview:**
This project focuses on improving Loblyst’s (alias for Loblaws) e-commerce platform to address issues such as low conversion rates, high bounce rates, and customer dissatisfaction. The first iteration, a Storyboard Prototype, demonstrates a revamped user interface and streamlined processes for online shopping. The enhancements aim to increase operational efficiency, boost user satisfaction, and expand market reach.

**Analysis and Opportunities:**

_Challenges Identified:_

•	Conversion Rate: Less than 2%, far below the desired benchmark of 4%.

•	Bounce Rate: High at 45-50%, driven by slow website load times (11 seconds).

•	Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): Low score of 2.5/5 due to inefficient processes and limited geographic reach.

_Benefits of the Initiative:_

•	Improved Performance: Reduced load times to 3-5 seconds, decreasing bounce rates and increasing user engagement.

•	Higher Conversion Rates: Optimized checkout flow aims to increase online purchases by 4%.

•	Expanded Reach: Extends operations beyond the GTA to areas like Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge.

•	Increased Satisfaction: Enhancements target a rise in CSAT to 4-4.5/5.

•	Operational Efficiency: Streamlined order fulfillment processes reduce delays and support tickets by 50%.
